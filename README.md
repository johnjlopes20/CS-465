**# Travlr Getaways - Full Stack Web Application**

Travlr Getaways is a full stack travel application developed as part of the CS 465 course project. Designed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js), this project aimed to create a responsive, dynamic website for travel planning. Travlr Getaways provides both a user-friendly, customer-facing interface and a secure, administrative backend to manage travel packages seamlessly. Through this project, I had the opportunity to explore the integration of multiple frameworks, building a comprehensive application that is functional, interactive, and highly adaptable.

In the course leading up to this project, I covered several competencies that have proven critical in building web applications. Specifically, these include designing the architecture of web applications, building them using frameworks, and developing and integrating databases. Through this project, I applied and expanded on these competencies, enhancing my understanding of the MEAN stack and the steps necessary for full stack development.

To create Travlr, I relied on the following tools and frameworks: Node.js for the backend server, Express for routing, MongoDB for data management, and Angular for the frontend interface. Each of these frameworks offered unique capabilities that enabled the creation of a seamless, interactive experience. To see a visual of the planned site layout, refer to the wireframe document provided in the project folder. While the initial design evolved throughout development, the wireframe served as a guiding reference.

The project development process included several stages of debugging and refactoring to ensure compatibility among frameworks, especially given the evolving versions of certain components. JavaScript, not being my primary language, presented a learning curve, but debugging became an engaging process of discovering how to integrate each tool effectively. My approach is generally methodical, emphasizing a deep understanding of each component's strengths and the application’s overall functionality. Debugging and refactoring became enjoyable learning experiences, reinforcing my skills and reinforcing my love for solving complex problems.

To install and run the project on your local machine, start by cloning the repository. After cloning, open the project in VS Code (or your preferred IDE), navigate to the app_admin folder to install dependencies and start the server. Once set up, navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the API and http://localhost:4200 to access the administrative backend. The setup instructions provide more specific steps if you need guidance with installation or troubleshooting.

For customers, the website’s main page offers easy access to travel package information via HTML, JavaScript, and Handlebars, all connected to MongoDB for data retrieval. The admin side is built as a single-page application (SPA) using Angular, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. Through this SPA, admins can log in, add, edit, or delete trips, with changes reflected instantly on the customer-facing page, creating a smooth and up-to-date experience for users.

Moving forward, there are several exciting enhancements on the roadmap. I plan to implement HTTPS support for improved security, add user registration options, and introduce pagination on the backend to better manage large sets of travel data.
